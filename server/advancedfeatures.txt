🎟️ Ticket System (Next Big Feature)

Generate unique QR codes for each ticket when purchased.

Save QR code (we already planned: store filename in DB + actual file in uploads/).

Implement ticket validation endpoint:

Organizer scans QR code → backend checks if valid (exists + unused).

Mark ticket as “used” once scanned.

Ticket dashboard for organizers:

See number of tickets sold.

See buyer list.




📊 Event Analytics (after ticketing)

Show stats per event (tickets sold, revenue, attendees list).

Graphs (line chart, bar chart, pie chart) in organizer dashboard.




🔔 Notifications & Emails (optional next step)

Send email confirmation after purchase with QR code attached.

Push/email reminders to attendees before event starts.




🔐 Access Control

Add role-based permissions:

Admin: Full access.

Organizer: Manage only their events.

User/Buyer: Buy tickets + view purchased tickets.



Push/Email Reminders

We can use a cron job (with node-cron) to check upcoming events and automatically send reminders 24h or 1h before.



Next Step: I’ll wire up the reminder system (push/email before event starts).
But first: do you want me to attach the QR code as an image inside the email (like above) or as a PDF/PNG file attachment?


Profile Feature

User Model Update (MongoDB)
Add fields like:

name

email

phone

profileImage

bio

role (attendee | organizer | admin)

Profile Routes (Backend, Express)

GET /api/profile/:id → fetch user profile

PUT /api/profile/:id → update user profile

POST /api/profile/upload → upload profile picture

Frontend (React)

Profile Page with sections:

Basic info (name, email, phone, role)

Profile photo upload

Tickets purchased (for attendees)

Events created (for organizers)

Extra Features (Later)

👉 Should we start by updating the User model in your backend to include bio, phone, and profileImage so we can build on that?
