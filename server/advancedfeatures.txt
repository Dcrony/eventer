🎟️ Ticket System (Next Big Feature)

Generate unique QR codes for each ticket when purchased.

Save QR code (we already planned: store filename in DB + actual file in uploads/).

Implement ticket validation endpoint:

Organizer scans QR code → backend checks if valid (exists + unused).

Mark ticket as “used” once scanned.

Ticket dashboard for organizers:

See number of tickets sold.

See buyer list.




📊 Event Analytics (after ticketing)

Show stats per event (tickets sold, revenue, attendees list).

Graphs (line chart, bar chart, pie chart) in organizer dashboard.




🔔 Notifications & Emails (optional next step)

Send email confirmation after purchase with QR code attached.

Push/email reminders to attendees before event starts.




🔐 Access Control

Add role-based permissions:

Admin: Full access.

Organizer: Manage only their events.

User/Buyer: Buy tickets + view purchased tickets.
